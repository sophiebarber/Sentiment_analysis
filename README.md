Project for Entertainment Economics: Emotional Arcs Analysis of Blockbuster Movie Scripts

Project Overview:
This project, conducted in December 2021, utilized advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and sentiment analysis to examine over 110 best-selling movie scripts. By integrating VADER sentiment analysis and 6th order polynomial curve fitting, it identified unique emotional patterns through K-means clustering. The highlight was the development of a novel emotional arc model, merging 'Icarus' and 'Cinderella' arcs, aimed at predicting box office success.

Practical Implications:
This analysis offers valuable insights into crafting narratives that resonate with audiences, potentially guiding filmmakers and screenwriters towards creating more engaging and successful movies. The approach not only aids in understanding audience preferences but also serves as a tool for predicting movie success, offering a strategic advantage in the competitive entertainment industry.
